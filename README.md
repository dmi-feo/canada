A replacement for DataLens' [United Storage](https://github.com/datalens-tech/datalens-us), running on [YT Cypress](https://ytsaurus.tech/docs/en/user-guide/storage/cypress) instead of postgres database.

It lacks a huge part of original US functionality (as well as tests for now), but still is capable to do some basic stuff.
